Implementations of language models, undirected graphical models etc.

## Models
### Vanilla Multi-Layer Perceptron / Deep Neural Network
  - Old implementation [here](https://github.com/akashram1/deep-learning/tree/master/1_vanilla_mlp/mlp_1_0) .
  - New implementation [here](https://github.com/akashram1/deep-learning/tree/master/1_vanilla_mlp/mlp_2_0). Used neat inheritance and polymorphism tricks along with other good coding practices
### Undirected Graphical Models
  - Read this [README](https://github.com/akashram1/deep-learning/tree/master/2_undirected_graphical_models/README.md)
  - Restricted Boltzmann Machines 
  - Autoencoder and Denoising Autoencoders
  - Results and Analysis in 
### Language Models
  - Basic Language MLP [here](https://github.com/akashram1/deep-learning/tree/master/3_language_models/project/mlp.py)
